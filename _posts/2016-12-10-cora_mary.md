Once upon a time, there lived an owl.  Her name was Cora.  She had a unique birthmark.  Her birthmark was a black patch around her eyes that looked like a mask.  None of the neighbor owls wanted to be friends with her because they thought her birthmark was ugly.  They didn’t even want to look at her.  Cora was very lonely.

Her parents kept reassuring her that she would make a friend some night.  But Cora was sure that they were just saying that to make her feel good.

Then one night, she was playing a lonely game of checkers all by herself.  Then there was a dreadful crashing sound.  The crash was coming from her favorite blue house in the town.

She flew over to the house and landed on the roof.  The roof wasn’t the most comfortable place in the world, but it would do for now.  She peered down and saw that the trash cans were knocked over.  So she just walked away slowly.  But WAIT! She turned around as fast as lightning because she just saw a flashback of right before she started the game of checkers (which was about 20 minutes ago). In her flashback, she saw that the trash cans weren’t knocked over. So she said to herself, “I shall just take a tiny peek.”

So she peered again over the edge and then she saw, out of the bushes, a tiny black nose as small as a button.  And then a bigger head!  And on that head, there was grey fur.  Around the eyes there was dark black fur in the shape of a mask! Just like hers!

Cora had never been so excited in her life!  She flew down and landed on the ground and then walked quietly to the peculiar creature.  Not wanting to frighten it, she said in her quietest voice - but not too quiet - “my name is Cora.  What is yours?”  The peculiar creature looked up and said, “You’re an owl, aren’t you?”  “Yes, I’m an owl,” replied Cora.  “And a very pretty owl!” replied the peculiar creature.  “I guess you should know what I am if we are going to be friends.”
Cora the owl said, “We’re going to be friends?”  Her eyes filled with tears from excitement.  Then Cora asked, “will you please tell me what you are?”  The creature replied, “of course, I will. I am a racoon.  And my name is Mary.  And I have a very unique birthmark too.”  Mary came all the way out of the bushes, slowly, careful not to wake the humanbeings.  Cora was amazed at what she saw on the racoon.  Mary was colorful, bright and beautiful with what looked like feathers but was fur.

“Tonight, do you want to have a slumber party and stay up late and watch what humans call the sunrise?” asked Cora.  Mary replied, “I would LOVE to!  I’ve never been invited to a slumber party!”

That is how Cora and Mary became friends.
